- Feature Name: Introduction of empty Ranges

- Pony Issue: (leave this empty)

# Summary

The RFC addresses the fact that for certain parameters, Pony currently creates infinite Range iterators that produce infinite numbers of values *outside* the range of values `min` and `max` provided to `Range`. For example the Range iterator `Range(10, 0)` produces the infinite sequence `10, 11, 12, ..` on subsequent calls to `.next()` where all but the first element do not lie within the range 10..0. One unexpected side effect of Pony's current behavior is that even though finite bounds are given, indefinitely-running actors and "hanging" programs can be produced. The fact that this RFC would bring Pony's Range much more in line with other common implementations of Range iterators that do allow floating point parameters and even infinite arguments -- for example Numpy's `arange()` function -- can be seen as a validating circumstance, but a more important goal is to prevent unintended infinitely iterating Range objects and indefinitely-running actors.

It is argued here that an iterator using the name `Range` should produce a sequence of values that lie within the `min, max` bounds. Therefore, most of what are now *infinite* ranges should instead be *empty* ranges (where `.has_next() == false`). The RFC proposes a delineation of the so-far *infinite* cases into one of two types: those that are now *empty*, and those which remain *infinite*.

A smaller issue proposed to be fixed by this RFC is the naming of the Range bounds `min` and `max`. Especially when an implementation allows for descending Ranges like Pony's does -- e.g. `Range(-10, -20, -1)`, naming the first parameter `min` and the second `max` is clearly mathematically wrong. Therefore if accepted, in the actual implementation these will be renamed to `start` and `end`. However, to not confuse things, they will still be named `min, max` throughout here.

# Motivation

Currently, a Range is considered infinite if either 1) the `step` is `0`, or any of `min`, `max`, or `step` are `NaN`, `+Inf` or `-Inf`, or 2) if no progress can be made from `min` to `max` due to the sign of the `step`.

In this RFC it will be argued that 1) is too broad in that it creates infinite iterators that should be *empty*, and that 2) should be entirely carved out from the set of currently *infinite* iterators all of which should also instead be *empty*. Currently, the following code fragment

```pony
  let r =  Range[I32](0, 10, -1)
  for i in Range(0, 10) do
    try env.out.print(r.next()?.string()) end
  end
```

produces

```
0
-1
-2
-3
-4
-5
-6
-7
-8
-9
```

All of these but the first value lie outside the range 0..10 that the user requested the Range class to generate. However, not the least based on the word *Range* -- defined by Merriam Webster as ".. 7a: a sequence, series, or scale between limits" -- the user can expect this to produce an iterator that generates all values along the *trajectory* from `min` to `max`, interspaced by `step`. Therefore, no sequence value should lie *outside* `[min, max)`.

The reason that Pony currently behaves counter to this is that it gives precedence to the combination of `min` and `step` and the iterative relationship `idx = idx + step` to produce the sequence values, regardless of the limits `min`, `max`. Algorithmically, it is currently designed as if saying: I know there are no elements (the implementation actually checks for this no-progress-possible within the given bounds situation), but I will walk indefinitely in the wrong direction because you told me so and hence I am infinite.

Beside the creation of possibly unwanted infinite loops, the current behavior also precludes the use of `Range` like in cases where the programmer *knows* and *makes use of* the fact that if the bounds (and the step) are not compatible sign-wise, the range will have zero iterations.
As an example of what would be `expressive` use of the Range bounds, consider the following code fragment:

```pony
  ...
  let f: Array[Array[String]] = csv.read("data.csv", ",") // reads whatever conforms to csv and returns a (possibly empty) array
  for idx in Range(1, f.size()) do // start at 1 to skip header line
    ... // perform only if f is not empty and has at least 1 data line
  end
```

This currently leads to a hanging actor/memory crash because the Range(1, f.size()) instead of being empty iterates infinitely in cases when the file "data.csv" exists but is empty, leading to an empty array in f. This code isn't particularly elegant or safe (a guard regarding f.size() should be put here), but it can still serve an example for how a programmer who would expect this Range to be empty in case of an empty f Array could utilize the Range parameters directly to ensure that the for loop is not executed by writing `Range(1, f.size())`.

Another problematic example of the current implementation is the response to any of the parameters being `NaN`.

```pony
  let nan = F64 = F64(0) / F64(0)
  let r =  Range[F64](0, 10, nan)
  for i in Range(0, 10) do
    try env.out.print(r.next()?.string()) end
  end
```

```
0
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
-nan(ind)
```

`NaN` is not a value and can therefore not possibly lie within any valid range. The same is true when one of the bound parameters is `NaN`. Under this RFC Range iterators that use `NaN` in any parameter are *empty*. Pony currently also considers those Ranges *infinite* where the `min, max` bounds are finite and identical but the `step` parameter is `+-Inf`. These cases too would be treated as empty since no iteration is necessary to advance from `min` to `max` regardless of the magnitude of `step`.

# Detailed design

## Current Implementation

Currently, a Range is considered infinite if either 1) the `step` is `0`, any of `min`, `max`, or `step` are `NaN`, `+Inf` or `-Inf`, or 2) if no progress can be made from `min` to `max` due to the sign of the `step`. Here is the corresponding relevant portion of the current range.pony implementation:

> ```

## Proposed reclassifications

This RFC partitions the set of currently *infinite* `Range` cases into those now considered *empty*, and a very small set of those that remain *infinite*. To discuss this discrimination, we first list three criteria. All three must be met for a currently *infinite* Range to *not* now be reclassified as empty -- if either of these criteria is violated, the Range is *empty*; if all three are met, a currently *infinite* Range remains so under this proposal.

  **Criterion 1** - progress from `min` to `max` must be possible. This necessitates the "no-progress expression" (discussion below) to be `false`.
  
  **Criterion 2** - the iterator that realizes the progress must produce *finite* values that lie within `[min, max)`.
  
  **Criterion 3** - none of the parameters `min, max, step` can be float `NaN`. (discussion below)

### Criterion 1 -- no-progress expression

The first criterion is related to the question whether progress from `min` to `max` is possible or needed. Numerical values including the floating point values `+Inf` and `-Inf` can be meaningfully compared in expressions like `min > max` or `max > min`. Based on this, an obvious absence of *progress* of the iteration from min towards max based on the sign of the Range parameters can be tested by the following *no-progress expression*: `((min <= max) and (step <= 0)) or ((min >= max) and (step >= 0))`, for both finite and infinite bounds.

Besides the cases with obvious sign-incompatibility of the three Range parameters, this expression also covers the cases of equal bounds `min == max` and `step == 0`. Equal bounds correspond to `[N, N)` which cannot contain any value, and the case of `step == 0` to a situation where no progress is possible. In the current implementation of Range, a somewhat similar couple of expressions are used with the comment `// no progress` and `// progress into other directions`, but they are treated as a sufficient condition for *infinite*. Here, this criterion is used to test for empty Ranges because no valid *trajectory* from min to max does exists with the provided parameters.

#### Examples for empty Ranges that violate criterion 1

`Range(0, 10, -1)` is *empty* nd no longer *infinite*, but so is in fact `Range(0, inf, -1)` that is also considered *infinite* currently. While one can generally never produce a complete list of elements that would incrementally move from say 0 to +Inf, we can know in the case of `Range(0, inf, -1)` that the Range must be *empty* because of the incompatible sign of the step parameter relative to the signs of `min` and `max`.
Other cases of Ranges that are now *empty* is when the bound equality `min == max` can be evaluated meaningfully, independent of whether `step` equals e.g. `0` or `+-Inf` like in case of `Range(10, 10, 0)`.

### Criterion 2 -- finite iterator values only

This criterion is enforced because the Range iterator produces new values by adding `step` to the last value. If an iteration value becomes e.g. `+Inf`, adding `step` does not change the value - the iterator again produces `+Inf`. Therefore, the iterator makes no progress numerically (indirectly violating Criterion 1). Also, while a `step` argument of `+-Inf` may "pass" the inspection by the "no-progress expression", e.g. `Range(0, 10, Inf)`, no finite points within the mathematical range `[min, max)` can be computed iteratively when `step` is `+-Inf`. This is also the case when `min` itself is `+-Inf`. Therefore, Ranges where `min` or `step` are infinite are *empty*, too.

### Criterion 3 -- no `NaN` parameters

The current `Range` implementation treats the occurrence of `+-Inf` or `NaN` parameters in *any* of the `min, max, step` parameters as sufficient condition for *infinite*. This RFC considers the opposite: the no-progress expression cannot be meaningfully evaluated if any one of the 3 tested parameters is a `NaN` value, and one can also not decide whether any .next() iterations which add `NaN` lie within the given numerical range, or, if `min` or `max` are `NaN`, what that range is in the first place. Any occurrence of `NaN` in the Range parameters therefore produces an *empty* Range. 

### Ranges that remain infinite

The cases that would remain infinite under this proposal are then only those which fulfill the following condition: they are not empty (as per the evaluation above) AND their upper bound is either +Inf or -Inf. Typical examples would be `Range[F64](0, inf, 1)` or `Range[F64](0, -inf, -1)`.

## New Implementation

For the discussion of the proposed algorithm, an expression of "progress" instead of "no-progress" is used.

```
no_progress = ((min <= max) and (step <= 0) or (min >= max) and (step >= 0))
progress = not no_progress = ((min > max) or (step > 0)) and ((min < max) or (step < 0))
                           = (((min > max ) or (step > 0)) and (min < max)) or (((min > max ) or (step > 0)) and (step < 0))
                           = ((step > 0) and (min < max)) or ((min > max ) and (step < 0))
                           = ((min < max) and (step > 0)) or ((min > max ) and (step < 0))
```

This is useful because `progress` allows to simultaneously test for both criteria 1 and 3 since `NaN` in any `min, max, step` automatically renders `progress` `false`. Criterion 2 is tested by `min.finite() and step.finite()`. Therefore the following expression allow an easiy classification of the Ranges:

```
not_empty = progress and min.finite() and step.finite() // .finite() => true if not `+-Inf` and not `NaN`
infinite = not_empty and max.infinite()
empty = not not_empty
```

This can be implemented, replacing the above original code portion, as follows:

```pony
class Range[A: (Real[A] val & Number) = USize] is Iterator[A]
  ..
  let _min: A
  let _max: A
  let _inc: A
  let _forward: Bool
  let _infinite: Bool
  let _empty: Bool
  var _idx: A

  new create(min: A, max: A, inc: A = 1) =>
    _min = min
    _max = max
    _inc = inc
    _forward = (_min < _max) and (_inc > 0)
    (let min_finite, let max_finite, let inc_finite) =
      iftype A <: FloatingPoint[A] then
        (_min.finite(), _max.finite(), _inc.finite())
      else
        (true, true, true)
      end
    let progress = ((_min < _max) and (_inc > 0))
                    or ((_min > _max) and (_inc < 0)) // false if any is NaN!
    if progress and min_finite and inc_finite then
      _empty = false
      _infinite = not max_finite // ok to use not max_finite for max_infinite
                                 // since progress excludes _max == nan
      _idx = _min
    else
      _empty = true
      _infinite = false
      _idx = _max // has_next() will return false without code modification
    end
```

Importantly, the original code for `.has_next()` and `.next()` does not require any changes! A modification that conserves the implementation "trick" to initialize `_idx = _max` for empty Ranges is required to `.rewind()`. Also, analogous to the existing `.is_infinite(): Bool` function, there is also a new `.is_empty()`.

```
  fun ref rewind() =>
    if _empty then _idx = _max else _idx = _min end // currently _idx = _min

  fun is_empty(): Bool =>
    _empty
```

## Performance Notes

The changes proposed here are performance-wise mostly related to the `Range` constructor. Due to the proposed design, no code changes in the performance critical `.has_next()` and `.next()` calls are necessary. Therefore only the performance impact of the modified constructor `create` was estimated with the following crude code (where RangeOld is the renamed original code and Range the new one):

```pony
...
// runtime new constructor
var t0 = Time.millis()
for i in RangeOld(0, 10_000_000) do // original implementation
  let r = Range[A].create(min, max, step) // new implementation
end
var t1 = Time.millis()
..
// runtime current constructor
t0 = Time.millis()
for i in RangeOld(0, 10_000_000) do // original implementation
  let r = RangeOld[A].create(min, max, step) // original implementation
end
t1 = Time.millis()
...
```
This was compiled with `--debug` so that the optimizer would not remove the not-further-used range instances; it was run 10 times to obtain an average runtime for a variety of Range types.

As you can see in the performance graph, the new constructor code is only marginally slower in the integer Range creation but a bit faster than the current code for all of the floating point Ranges.

# How We Teach This

## Proposed Docstring

The current docstring contains roughly two parts: the first part, which would remain unchanged, talks about the general use, and the second part addresses infinite Ranges and the use of floating point arguments (including those producing infinite Ranges). The docstring is proposed to be changed only in the second part which currently reads:

> If the `step` is not moving `min` towards `max` or if it is `0`,
> the Range is considered infinite and iterating over it
> will never terminate:
> 
> ```pony
> let infinite_range1 = Range(0, 1, 0)
> infinite_range1.is_infinite() == true
> 
> let infinite_range2 = Range[I8](0, 10, -1)
> for _ in infinite_range2 do
> env.out.print("will this ever end?")
> env.err.print("no, never!")
> end
> ```
> 
> When using `Range` with  floating point types (`F32` and `F64`)
> `inc` steps < 1.0 are possible. If any of the arguments contains
> `NaN`, `+Inf` or `-Inf` the range is considered infinite as operations on
> any of them won't move `min` towards `max`.
> The actual values produced by such a `Range` are determined by what IEEE 754
> defines as the result of `min` + `inc`:
> 
> ```pony
> for and_a_half in Range[F64](0.5, 100) do
> handle_half(and_a_half)
> end
> 
> // this Range will produce 0 at first, then infinitely NaN
> let nan: F64 = F64(0) / F64(0)
> for what_am_i in Range[F64](0, 1000, nan) do
> wild_guess(what_am_i)
> end
> ```
> 

which could, for example, be modified to:

> If `inc` is nonzero, but cannot produce progress towards max because of its sign, the `Range` is considered empty and will not produce any iterations. The `Range` is also empty if either `min` equals `max`, independent of the value of the step parameter `inc`, or if `inc` is zero.

Tests for the correct behavior can be added to `packages/collections/_test.pony` by adding a `_assert_empty` function analogous to the existing `_assert_infinite` function while adjusting the latter by removing cases that are no longer infinite from the current `_assert_infinite` tests. The tests will cover the ones listed as examples in the Details section.

# Drawbacks

This is a breaking change. Any existing code that relies on currently infinite iterators that under this RFC are no longer infinite (which are most) would not function properly. Any code that for example, in place of a `while true do` loop, uses:

```Pony
for i in Range[F64](F64(0) / F64(0)) do
  // runs forever unless "broken" out of
```
would no longer work as intended.

The current implementation also provides an `.is_infinite()` function to test whether the iterator will indefinitely return values. This function could be currently be in use in to *avoid* iterating over Ranges that might be infinite or to produce appropriate errors. Since this RFC reduces the number of cases in which Ranges are infinite, this might produce side effects in existing code even if that code does not purposely use infinite Ranges as control structures like the first example. This could for example prevent certain error messages from getting displayed that were used in combination with such tests. It is on the other hand fair to state that a search of public Pony code on Github did not yield any uses of `.is_infinite()` outside test code associated with tests for the Range implementation. This could be taken as a sign that infinite Ranges and guarding code against their effects are not widely used. It is also worth noting that `.is_infinite()` will still return true for all remaining infinite Range cases so that any use as a guard should likely remain intact.

# Alternatives

An alternative would be a reinterpretation of the user-provided parameters in the currently *infinite* cases. For example, the currently infinite `Range(0, 10, -1)` could be re-arranged to mean `Range(10, 0, -1)`. An argument against transforming Range(0, 10, -1) into Range(10, 0, -1) is that Range evaluates expressions using the provided parameters in their meaning of `min` and `max` or `start` and `end`. In conjunction with the step parameter there is a directionality (trajectory) which does not only control the numbers of the sequence but also the order within the sequence. Instead of `0, 1, .., 9` the Range would produce  `10, 9, .., 1` -- different numbers in a different order.
Furthermore, having empty Ranges when using `Range` with calculated, non-literal bounds also has an *expressive* use (see CSV reader example in Motivation section) which the reinterpretation of the parameters to always return a non-empty Range would preclude.

Another fair alternative is to leave everything as it is. Pony has been in fairly wide-spread use academically and to some degree even commercially, without anyone reporting the issues that for the author were the reason to start working on this RFC -- which was hanging (eventually running out of memory) Pony code. One could therefore speculate that the side effects and instances in which currently infinite Ranges are created are sufficiently documented and known by the majority of users of Pony.
Nonetheless, as laid out in the summary and motivation sections, the use of the word Range suggests a behavior that is different from the current one. Therefore, if this RFC is not accepted, I'd suggest to better point out how Pony's use of `Range` is contrary to both the mathematical meaning and the use of iterator objects of that name in many other programming languages, and how this can lead to infinite loops over unintendedly infinite `Range` iterators. The current Range docstring does state this behavior and provides an example (infinite_range2), but this is possibly not prominent enough given the gravity of the discrepancy between reasonable expectation and behavior.
