# Summary

This RFC proposes the addition of the io package to the standard library. This package will contain interfaces to address the common actions of reading and writing data. The ReadBuffer and WriteBuffer classes will also be moved from the net package into the new io package so that they are more easily discovered.

# Motivation

Most applications need to process some input and produce some output based on that input. Therefore, these operations should be raised above application specific packages so that they can be used in a generalized way.

# Detailed design

The io package will contain the following interfaces:
```pony
interface Readable
  """
  Wraps the basic read method which returns up to len bytes from the input.
  """
  fun read(len: USize): Array[U8] iso^

interface Writable
  """
  Wraps the basic write method which writes data to the output and returns false if the data was not written properly.
  """
  fun ref write(data: ByteSeq): Bool
```

The net/ReadBuffer and net/WriteBuffer classes will also be moved to the io package.

# How We Teach This

The seperation of any general concern of input/output operations will clarify the use of classes such as the ReadBuffer and Writebuffer.

# Drawbacks

The relocation of the net/ReadBuffer and net/WriteBuffer would break existing code.

# Alternatives

None.

# Unresolved questions

None.
