- Feature Name: Split `FilePath` constructor to guarantee constructor with `AmbientAuth`
- Start Date: 2021-07-02
- RFC PR:
- Pony Issue:

# Summary

It should be without error to constructor a `FilePath` when `AmbientAuth` is available. The current constructor uses a union of `(FilePath | AmbientAuth)` to limit capabilities and access for the newly created `FilePath`. Insufficient capabilities or access allows the first half of this union, `FilePath`, to fail, however the latter half `AmbientAuth` can never fail.

# Motivation

Beyond making `FilePath` more convenient, this change will allow use cases where a path is guaranteed such as constructing a path to the root directory. Currently, all `FilePath` objects must be constructed within a try-else block. Importantly, `FilePath` does not guarantee its post-construction operations will succeed, however a `FilePath` is merely a combination of some directory path and capabilities. No changes to __using__ a `FilePath` are intended by this change, only construction is affected.

# Detailed design

The suggested change is to split the implementation in two around the current match statement with `create` using a new package-level root authority `FileAuth` (created from `AmbientAuth`) and a new constructor called `from` using an existing `FilePath`.

Current constructor (documentation excluded):

```pony
  new val create(
    base: (FilePath | AmbientAuth),
    path': String,
    caps': FileCaps val = recover val FileCaps .> all() end)
    ?
  =>
    caps.union(caps')

    path = match base
      | let b: FilePath =>
        if not b.caps(FileLookup) then
          error
        end

        let tmp_path = Path.join(b.path, path')
        caps.intersect(b.caps)

        if not tmp_path.at(b.path, 0) then
          error
        end
        tmp_path
      | let b: AmbientAuth =>
        Path.abs(path')
      end
```

Will become:

```pony
  new val create(
    base: FileAuth,
    path': String,
    caps': FileCaps val = recover val FileCaps .> all() end)
  =>
    caps.union(caps')

    path = Path.abs(path')
```

and

```pony
  new val from(
    base: FilePath,
    path': String,
    caps': FileCaps val = recover val FileCaps .> all() end)
    ?
  =>
    caps.union(caps')
    if not base.caps(FileLookup) then
      error
    end

    let tmp_path = Path.join(base.path, path')
    caps.intersect(base.caps)

    if not tmp_path.at(base.path, 0) then
      error
    end
    path = tmp_path
```

Definition of `FileAuth`:

```pony
primitive FileAuth
  new create(from: AmbientAuth) =>
    None
```

This matches the net package design of using a package-level root authority rather than `AmbientAuth` directly.

# How We Teach This

Nothing about our teaching should need to change, however this change will allow early tutorials to avoid introducing try-else blocks and partial functions for longer if they so choose. For example, with a separate `FilePath` constructor an early tutorial could construct a `FilePath` to a file containing a simple message in the current directory, construct the necessary `File`, and call `File.read()` or `File.lines()`, none of which would be partial functions after this change -- such a program is just beyond the complexity of the ever ubiquitous "Hello, World" initial lesson.

Advanced users of Pony, should have little difficulty switching based on the simple statistics from stdlib below.

- Uses of `FilePath`: 166
- Uses of `FilePath(...)` from `AmbientAuth`: 37
- Uses of `_ as FilePath` typing: 19
- Uses of `FilePath(...)` not from `AmbientAuth`: 29
- Uses referring to `FilePath` for its type (e.g., within unions): 53
- Uses excluding the above (mostly documentation): 28

# How We Test This

All unit tests with need to be updated as nearly all existing tests use `AmbientAuth`. At least one additional unit test is recommended to check that serial construction first via `FileAuth` then via `FilePath.from(...)` using the first construction's `FilePath` is error-free when both are attempting to access an identical path.

Existing unit tests will need to change as the common phrase `let filepath = FilePath(h.env.root as AmbientAuth, path)?` will no longer work. As well, `var tmp_dir: (FilePath | None) = ...` will likely not be needed in as many places as this is a defense against `FilePath` failing within a try statement.

# Drawbacks

- Breaks existing code
- Added maintenance cost

# Alternatives

Keeping the implementation as it currently is written. There is nothing overtly wrong with the existing implementation, this RFC is a suggestion for making the files package easier to use.

# Unresolved questions

Does this have farther reaching affects beyond what is initially seen? Are there current patterns outside of stdlib for managing `FilePath`s? Do we have any need for sub-authorities below `FileAuth`?
